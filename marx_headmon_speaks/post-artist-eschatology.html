<h2>Notes Toward a post-Artist Eschatology</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Nonconformity is being redefined as a mental illness.</li>

  <li>
    Apocalypse in the original sense meant a revelation (literally: an
    uncovering,) not a grand, destructive cataclysm. Armageddon is the
    cataclysm, apocalypse is the moment we know it is coming or possible.
  </li>

  <li>
    In the 1990s, the intellectual conversation over postmodernism was whether
    or not it was happening and whether it was possible to define “the now”
    without the benefit of historical distance. The term post-modernity better
    defines that time; it was the apocalypse of modernism, the moment we
    realized how deeply flawed modernism is and, thus, the Enlightenment and
    capitalism, and the realization that this era is drawing to a close,
    eventually to be replaced by something else, not the end of history itself.
  </li>

  <li>
    Our contemporaneity is the post-apocalypse. We are watching the era of the
    -isms and the -ologies pass. What will replace them?
  </li>

  <li>
    At the turn of the 21st century, reforms allowed Chinese artists to embrace
    the themes and representations of Western contemporary art. They began a
    period of experimentation, embracing their “fin de siécle,” often forming
    artists' collectives and communities on the outskirts of the major city
    centers. They became known for their innovative work and performances. Some
    were offered positions in the apparatus of State art institutions, by doing
    so, often making a choice that would pull them away from the experimental
    work which made them visible. Often those embracing the precarity of
    nonconformity instead of commodification were “disappeared” when their
    artistic representation threatened the mythologies of the Chinese State
    while Artists like Ai Wei Wei chose global recognition.
  </li>

  <li>
    Choosing nonconformity is a form of subalterity.
  </li>

  <li>
    The field of Artists using online technologies to create representation is
    wide and deep. BUT much of it interacts with or responds to social media
    platforms.
  </li>

  <li>
    Most of it seems activist OR performative OR critical commentary.
  </li>

  <li>
    Those that perform internet punnery in the form of memes or approach the
    sublime in the form of glitch or game or algorithmic complexity posit or
    reference a possible post-human dystopia that lies just beyond the event
    horizon – this Armageddon waits with nasty, long, pointed teeth – which
    seems honest, but often nihlistic.
  </li>

  <li>
    Activism among Artists grows, continuing to expand the field of art. Often
    this is “liberty-seeking,” experiments with technologies that attempt to
    escape the reach or control of Authority and give back control to local
    communities, the people, individuals. Why have so many Artists embraced
    online technologies as a solution to perceived social ills? Why (might work
    better without the word why)is there hope that commodification and
    surveillance aren't inherent in these systems?
  </li>

  <li>
    Choosing experimentation, expanding the field of art, has led Artists to a
    choice between institutional practices or experimentation, conformity or
    subalterity.
  </li>

  <li>
    Is it enough to be a critic, a cagey observer picking a neutral stance
    “reporting” on what is? Artists like Hitto Steryl charm the liberal elite
    (who ooze with pity for the noble subaltern) by performing their art in the
    form of TED-type talks for those who aren't in the place between. Is this
    really the space between Utopia and Dystopia?
  </li>

  <li>
    What is needed is a transcendent cynicism. For if the end comes soon, live
    it on your own terms, play the character you want to be. Even in the somber
    face of inevitable societal change, it is a valid hope that we have the
    agency to make things better than they are, better than they were, better
    than They want them to be. Even if the technological elite succeed in using
    the spoils of Empire to act out Lyotard's post-modern fable by escaping the
    gravity well as human consciousness in some form, the rest of us will be
    left here to find love in the ruins. Even the curmudgeon enjoys human touch.
  </li>

  <li>
    What replaces the Artists of this moment of contemporaneity? If commodity
    dissipates as modernism ends, as the field of art grows, as the moment
    becomes the next, do we simply become entertainers, gadflies, cultural
    critics or experimenters? Are we divinators, somber bell-wethers, sages or
    magicians?
  </li>

  <li>
    These are the questions of our time, of the way Artists choose to spend
    their days. And the way Artists will choose the time and place of their own
    death, for to perform as a subaltern is to learn to pass inside the
    interstices of the structure that Authority dictates. With that comes
    premature death due to increased stress, precarious housing, less accessible
    health care, etc., etc.
  </li>

  <li>
    Live as if experimentation and transversality are the norm, not the
    non-conform. Perform and pass, survive and flourish by finding hidden gaps
    in whatever didactism Authority dictates. The grand narrative is dead. Long
    live the new substrate.
  </li>
</ul>
