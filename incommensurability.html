    <h2>incommensurability</h2>
    <p>
      yeah, but we really don't kid, we shitpost cuz laughing thru the tears
      isn't enough. the kindness in humanity is a fading light.
      <br /><br />
      it IS increasingly hard to live, hard to find hope in a world of such deep
      and abiding incommensurability - the post-industrial, capitalist,
      post-slavery West sloughs inexorably into post-human algorithmic
      efficiency.

      but i FIND hope where i can. i don't HAVE it. it isn't static. we MAKE it.
      we SHARE it. we STRUGGLE toward it. it is what makes us HUMAN. we RESIST
      the machinic totalization of our time and agency. it is all we CAN do, so
      it is what we MUST do, what we WILL do.
