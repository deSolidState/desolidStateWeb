    <h2>deSolid State (aka Tim Combs)</h2>

    <p>
      deSolid State is an interdisciplinary artist, coder, educator, and web
      developer with a hybrid new media practice, working through the
      intersections of machinic intelligence, distributed interaction, and
      visual abstraction by creating physical and digital works on a variety of
      analogue and digital platforms to drive conversation about that which is
      easily overlooked and ignored. These works often take the form of
      interactive Twitter bots, real-time experimental video performances,
      Tumblr galleries, websites, or sculptural installation.

    <p>
      He is currently fascinated with the ethical implications of our
      contemporaneous blend of real and irreal spaces, our online and off-line
      worlds. As new patterns, new visual “grammars” continue to emerge across
      platforms and technologies for audience engagement, he comments on the
      exponential increase of video screens, and how our interactions are
      increasingly distributed, collated, tracked, and stored in real-time by
      algorithmic systems across the internet.
